#Fruit Quality Prediction using Deep Learning

Abstract

The increasing demand for high-quality fruits in both local and global markets necessitates effective methods for assessing fruit quality. Traditional methods of evaluating fruit healthiness are often labor-intensive, subjective, and can lead to inconsistencies in quality control. To address these challenges, this project focuses on the prediction and classification of the healthiness of various Indian fruits based on their size and visual characteristics, utilizing advanced deep learning techniques.

Leveraging the FruitNet dataset, which comprises over 14,700 high-quality images of six popular Indian fruits—apple, banana, guava, lime, orange, and pomegranate—this study employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically the InceptionResNetV2 model. The dataset is organized into three categories: good quality, bad quality, and mixed quality, providing a comprehensive framework for training and evaluating the model.
